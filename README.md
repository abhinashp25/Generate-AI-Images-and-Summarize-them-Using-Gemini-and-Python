# Generate-AI-Images-and-Summarize-them-Using-Gemini-and-Python
🌸 AI Bouquet Generator & Birthday Wish Creator (Vertex AI)

This project demonstrates how to use Google Vertex AI to generate images from text and then analyze those images using a multimodal AI model.

It combines text-to-image generation and image-to-text analysis in a single Python application.

🚀 Project Overview

The application performs two main tasks:

Generates a bouquet image using a text prompt with Google’s Imagen model

Analyzes the generated image and creates a short birthday wish using Gemini

This project is inspired by a real-world use case where users describe their desired bouquet and receive both a visual preview and a meaningful message.
